        The biggest scoreline in the history of the <strong>FIFA World Cup</strong> qualifiers -
        and indeed in the history of international football - was recorded on 11
        April 2001, when Australia beat American Samoa 31-0.

        This legendary match also brought global renown for <em>Archie Thompson</em>,
        whose 13-goal haul set a new world record, which stands to this day, for
        an individual player in a single international match.
      </p>

        And though the defeat earned American Samoa ignominy, so inspiring has
        their subsequent recovery been that it is now the subject of an
        acclaimed documentary, <em>'Next Goal Wins'</em>, showing across the world.
